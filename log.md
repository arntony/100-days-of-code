### Day 2: October 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Kaggle micro-course on Machine Learning and started Intermediate course on ML.

- Built decision tree model on Housing Price Prediction
- Submitted assignment to my very first Kaggle challenge
- Improved the model by using Random Forest algorithm
- Learning different hyper parameters used in RF Regressor

**Thoughts** Strengthening my resolve in completing this 100 days challenge with loads of learning. Exciting day ahead...!!!

### Day 3: October 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Built an improved model on House price prediction by applying imputation in Random forest regressor.

- Explored ways of handling missing values in numeric data sets
- Tried modeling by droping columns with missing values
- Tried imputation using default strategy (mean)
- Experimented using median as strategy for imputing null values

**Thoughts** Thinking of ways to improve the current model, eager to learn more but no rush now. Persistance is key...!!!
