# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 6, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Completed micro-course of Intro to Machine Learning on Kaggle.

- Built basic decision tree model in python, for housing price prediction
- Evaluated best fit tree size for the model
- Built random forest model on the same data set

**Thoughts** First interaction with anything on kaggle. Developed an appreciation for the platform.

### Day 2: October 7, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on handling missing values in the data in first exercise of micro-course of Intermediate Machine Learning on Kaggle. Small tricks but huge learning.

**Thoughts** Improved rank in housing price challenge by 3,998 places, but that is nothing compared to learning. Looking forward to learn more, would be great to know thought process of others who worked on this problem without these courses.

### Day 3: October 8, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about handling categorical columns in the data in second exercise of micro-course of Intermediate Machine Learning on Kaggle

The basic techniques:
1. Drop the column
2. Use Label encoding for ordinal values
3. One hot encoding for nominal values

### Day 4: October 9, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Applied learning from last two days to the kaggle competition. Came across another challenge where test data had some more missing values in other columns, number of which was very small.
Still to get understanding of this, but lot of learning in this handson excercise.

- Handled missing values in train and validation data
- One hot encoded the categorical values with smaller cardinality (<10).

Later, did some excercises on python data types and functions
