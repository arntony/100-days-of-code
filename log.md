# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 14, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Kaggle micro-course on Python.

- Revised python basics
- Completed all the coding challanges offered

**Thoughts** Familiarized myself with the famous Kaggle platform. Liking it already!!

### Day 2: October 15, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Completed Kaggle micro-course on Machine Learning and started Intermediate course on ML.

- Built decision tree model on Housing Price Prediction
- Submitted assignment to my very first Kaggle challenge
- Improved the model by using Random Forest algorithm
- Learning different hyper parameters used in RF Regressor

**Thoughts** Strengthening my resolve in completing this 100 days challenge with loads of learning. Exciting day ahead...!!!

### Day 3: October 16, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Built an improved model on House price prediction by applying imputation in Random forest regressor.

- Explored ways of handling missing values in numeric data sets
- Tried modeling by droping columns with missing values
- Tried imputation using default strategy (mean)
- Experimented using median as strategy for imputing null values

**Thoughts** Thinking of ways to improve the current model, eager to learn more but no rush now. Persistence is key...!!!

### Day 4: October 17, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Learnt implementing categorical variables and ML piplines. Improved the house price prediction model in process. 

- Explored ways of handling categorical variables
- Learnt three different ways of treating CV. Elimiation, Label encoding, One Hot Encdoing
- Understood the different checks and actions necessary to be performed before applying label encoding/one-hot encoding to avoid errors
- Learnt how to implement ML pipelines using scikit learn packages

**Thoughts** Kaggle's bite size courses are packed with so much knowledge that I am forced to optimize my learning pace. Read every line...!!!
